The Antiphanes riddle speaks of
letters
of the alphabet
which though
voiceless
raise a ringing


shout


over the waves of the ocean
and all the mainland

But it turns out
they are shouting
only to the addressee
of the letter which contains them
for those standing by him as he reads
cannot hear a thing
